        <p>Well she's walking through the clouds<br />
        With a circus mind that's running round<br />
        Butterflies and zebras and moonbeams and fairy tales<br />
        That's all she ever thinks about<br />
        Riding with the wind<br /></p>
        <p><i>-- Jimi Hendrix, Little Wing</i></p>
