# Robert's Flickr Image Search App
### Project 7, Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree

Extra Credit features included:
- loading indicator
- friendly error message when there are no search results
- friendly 404 error handling
- pasting a search route URL correctly displays the search results
- I included alt text in my photo elements
- I added a 'Helmet' element to change the name of the title in the browser pane (see note below)
- I added some google fonts and made other minor styling changes

This project uses React, React Router, JSX and Axios to implement a Flickr Image Search App.

The App itself consists of nothing but routing to the correct components. All app state is maintained in the PhotoContainer component, which uses ComponentDidUpdate() to maintain state and fetch new data when required. All other components are stateless.

My design does not require separate Route tags for each of my four main topics because I treat them exactly the same as a search query. One Route tag handles any simple URL. If the user types a second / in the url (such as "localhost:3000//butterflies/red") they will receive a friendly 404 message.

Important note: You will notice one warning in the console when the page loads. This is due to my use of the Helmet
component. The warning is not generated by my code.
